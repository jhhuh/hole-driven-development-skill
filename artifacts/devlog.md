# Devlog — Hole Driven Development Skills

## 2026-03-01 — Project kickoff

- Brainstormed design with user
- Three-layer architecture: core → compiler loop → iterative reasoning
- Core is ~150 words, stable
- Compiler loop starts Haskell-only, extensible to Lean 4 and Rust
- Iterative reasoning writes visible HOLE markers to file
- Full autonomy in the loop; stop on ambiguity or stuck
- Design doc committed
